# GoMyCode Vibe Coding - Personal Intro Landing Page

## Overview
This is a simple personal landing page project created as part of the **GoMyCode Vibe Coding** checkpoint.  
The page serves as an introduction to my profile, including my name, a subtitle, and a call-to-action button labeled **"View My Projects"**.

## How It Was Built
- Generated the initial layout using **Lovable AI**.
- Customized the **layout** and **color theme** via the Lovable UI tool.
- Exported the HTML and CSS into my editor (**VS Code**).
- Made one **manual improvement**: adjusted font styling and spacing.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Lovable AI
- Visual Studio Code

## Features

- Hero header with name, subtitle, and CTA button.

## Project Goal
To demonstrate my ability to create and customize simple UI projects using AI tools, while applying basic frontend skills (HTML & CSS).
